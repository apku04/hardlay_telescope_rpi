# Hardlay Telescope RPi

This repository contains an Arduino sketch for driving an alt-az telescope mount using stepper motors.

The code defines two axes (azimuth and altitude) with configurable pins and movement parameters. Functions are organized so new axes or features can easily be added.

Open `hardlay_telescope_rpi.ino` in the Arduino IDE or compile with `arduino-cli` targeting a compatible board.
